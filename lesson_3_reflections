all your work local?

When other people have to be able to reach the information too eg.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you need to time your work with whoever else is making changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is local, clones moves files, forks to collaborate with other
people
